/**
 * IONS: Animation Tokens
 *
 * Animation-specific design primitives including durations, timing functions, and keyframes.
 * These tokens ensure consistent motion design across the application.
 *
 * Duration Scale:
 * - instant: 0ms - Immediate changes with no transition
 * - fast: 100ms - Quick feedback (hover states, tooltips)
 * - normal: 200ms - Standard transitions (buttons, dropdowns)
 * - moderate: 300ms - Noticeable motion (modals, panels)
 * - slow: 500ms - Deliberate animations (page transitions)
 * - slower: 700ms - Emphasized motion (loading states)
 * - slowest: 1000ms - Long-form animations (intro sequences)
 *
 * Timing Functions:
 * - linear: Constant speed throughout (progress bars, spinners)
 * - in: Accelerate from slow start (exit animations)
 * - out: Decelerate to slow end (entrance animations)
 * - inOut: Accelerate then decelerate (most UI transitions)
 *
 * Keyframe Animations:
 * - spin: 360° rotation loop (loading spinners)
 * - ping: Scale pulse with fade (notification indicators)
 * - pulse: Opacity fade in/out (breathing effect)
 * - bounce: Vertical bounce motion (draw attention)
