								<Text variant="muted">
									Cookies are small text files (typically containing a string of
									letters and numbers) that are placed on your device —
									computer, tablet, or mobile phone — when you visit a website.
									Cookies are widely used by website operators to make their
									sites work efficiently, provide analytics data, and remember
									your preferences. They are stored locally on your device and
									read by the server on subsequent visits.
								</Text>
								<Text variant="muted">
									SkillVector uses cookies and similar client-side storage
									technologies (including localStorage and sessionStorage)
									sparingly and only where they serve a clear purpose. We
									categorize our cookies according to their function: strictly
									necessary, functional, performance, analytics, security, and
									third-party. This policy explains what each category does,
									what specific cookies are set, how long they persist, and how
									you can manage your preferences.
								</Text>
								<Text variant="muted">
									This Cookie Policy should be read together with our Privacy
									Policy and Terms of Service, which provide additional context
									on how we handle your data. By continuing to use the Service
									after being presented with the cookie consent banner, you
									consent to the use of cookies as described in this Policy. You
									may withdraw your consent at any time — see the "Managing Your
									Cookie Preferences" section below.

									Impact of Disabling Cookies
								</Heading>
								<Text variant="muted">
									Please be aware that disabling or blocking certain cookies may
									affect the functionality of SkillVector. In particular: if you
									disable strictly necessary cookies, you may be unable to log
									in, maintain a session, or access authenticated features. If
									you disable functional cookies, the Service may not remember
									your preferences, search history, or UI settings. If you
									disable performance and analytics cookies, we will be unable
									to collect data to improve the Service, but this will not
									affect core functionality.

									Do Not Track (DNT) Signals
								</Heading>
								<Text variant="muted">
									Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that
									signals to websites that you do not wish to be tracked.
									SkillVector honors DNT signals — when a DNT signal is
									detected, we will disable all non-essential cookies and
									analytics tracking for that session. Please note that there is
									currently no uniform standard for how DNT signals should be
									interpreted, and not all browsers support or enable DNT by
									default.
